# Best Practices for Asking Coding Questions in Slack

* Ask, don’t fish
	* The #rails slack channel is extremely active and 99% of the time someone will answer you. It’s best to just ask your question instead of “fishing for” if someone is “available to help” or if someone has “gone through x-checkpoint.” Answering questions about availability to peers often implies a commitment that a peer may not be able/willing to fulfill. While everyone is extremely generous, sometimes when put in this position, they’ll elect to ignore rather than to answer “no” or “yes.”

* Be clear and concise
	* Asking broad questions that are hard to answer or that require a lot of questions for clarity is not best. The more specific you’re question can get, the better. ex. “I thought that this method would do this, but I ended up getting this error, did I call it or define it wrong?” (which brings us to our next guideline)
	* Explain your thought process.

* Use Snippets and organize them
	* If you’re encountering a specific issue that consists of multiple lines of code, error messages, or multiple files, use snippets. Snippets should be organized by file and should be prepended with a comment with the file path, filename, and extension.
	* It’s best practice to put the error message at the bottom of the code, as it can mess up syntax highlighting if it’s at the top or the middle.
	* Try to maintain the correct file hierarchy from top being the highest parent in question, to the lowest child. ex. <main>.file <dependency>.file <dependency of dependency>.file

* Don’t be afraid of appearing dumb or stupid.
	* Everybody makes rookie mistakes, and everyone in the #rails channel has made them too. Don’t be afraid to share yours, it’s not only a good way to learn, but a great way to learn to take feedback.
	* When explaining your thought process, don’t be afraid to have missed a concept. No one understands everything the first time they read it or hear about it, so why should you?

* Be honest
	* If your peer has helped you and asks if you understood, be honest. Not only is it an opportunity for you to learn, but it’s also an opportunity for someone else to chime in and offer perspective maybe your first peer couldn’t/didn’t give.
